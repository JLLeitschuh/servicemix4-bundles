    FlatPack came out of the frustration of having to mix file parsing logic with business logic.

    FlatPack is a Java (1.4+) flat file parser that handles CSV, fixed length and custom delimiters. The
    formats are configured in XML, it is fast and released under Apache license 2.0.

    Starting at release 3.1, FlatPack introduces exporters via the writer package. This mechanism allows you
    to export a DataSet to a fixed length or delimited format.

    Substrings in a fixed width parse can be daunting to deal with when trying to analyze what existing code is
    doing, and what about when you have no comments...

    It also provides delimited file parsing; works with any delimiter / qualifier, multiline records, delimiter
    or qualifier allowed in column value.
