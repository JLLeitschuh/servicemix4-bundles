\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    BeanIO is an open source Java framework for marshalling and unmarshalling Java beans,
    or plain old java objects (POJO's), from large flat files or streams. Using an XML mapping file, BeanIO can be
    easily configured to read objects from an input stream and write objects to an output stream. BeanIO is particularly
    well suited for batch processing, and currently supports XML, CSV, delimited, and fixed length file formats.

    Features:

    * Support for XML, CSV, delimited and fixed length stream formats
    * Common field validation rules with customizable error messages
    * Configurable record ordering and grouping rules
    * XML based field mapping
    * Extensible type handling
    * Integration with Spring Batch

    The BeanIO project is hosted at Google Code
