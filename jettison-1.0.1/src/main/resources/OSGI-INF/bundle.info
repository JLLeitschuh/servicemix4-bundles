\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Jettison is a collection of Java APIs (like STaX and DOM) which read and write JSON. This allows nearly transparent
    enablement of JSON based web services in services frameworks like CXF or XML serialization frameworks like XStream.

    There are currently two included conventions for mapping JSON to XML. The first, is BadgerFish which implements the
    full XML infoset in JSON using various techniques. The second, is called the "mapped" convention. It allows you to
    manually map XML namespaces to JSON element prefixes.

    Jettison was developed for usage in XFire and CXF to enable JSON based services. Later it also found its place in
    Java object serialization with XStream
