\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Commons CSV was started to unify a common and simple interface for reading and writing CSV files under an
    ASL license. It has been bootstrapped by a code donation from Netcetera in Switzerland. There are three
    pre-existing BSD compatible CSV parsers which this component will hopefully make redundant:

        * Skife CSV
        * Open CSV
        * Genjava CSV
