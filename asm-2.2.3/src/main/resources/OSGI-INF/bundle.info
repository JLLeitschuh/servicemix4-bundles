\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework. It can be used to modify existing
    classes or dynamically generate classes, directly in binary form. Provided common transformations and
    analysis algorithms allow to easily assembly custom complex transformations and code analysis tools.

    ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but it is focused on simplicity of use and
    performance. Because it was designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it makes it
    very attractive for using in dynamic systems.
