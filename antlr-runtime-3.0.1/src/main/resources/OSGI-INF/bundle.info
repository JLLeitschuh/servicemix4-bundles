DESCRIPTION
    ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, is a language tool that provides a framework for constructing
    recognizers, interpreters, compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing actions in a
    variety of target languages (Java, C, C++, Python, etc).
    ANTLR provides excellent support for tree constructions, tree walking, translation, error recovery, and
    error reporting.
