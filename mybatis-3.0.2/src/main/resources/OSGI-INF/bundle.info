\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    The MyBatis data mapper framework makes it easier to use a relational database with object-oriented applications.
    MyBatis couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is the biggest
    advantage of the MyBatis data mapper over object relational mapping tools.

    To use the MyBatis data mapper, you rely on your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you
    don't already know. With the MyBatis Data Mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored procedures at your
    fingertips.
