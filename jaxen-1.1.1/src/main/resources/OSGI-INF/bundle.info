\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Jaxen is an open source XPath library written in Java. It is adaptable to many different object models, including
    DOM, XOM, dom4j, and JDOM. Is it also possible to write adapters that treat non-XML trees such as compiled Java
    byte code or Java beans as XML, thus enabling you to query these trees with XPath too.
