    jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting
    and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

    jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.

    * scrape and parse HTML from a URL, file, or string
    * find and extract data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
    * manipulate the HTML elements, attributes, and text
    * clean user-submitted content against a safe white-list, to prevent XSS attacks
    * output tidy HTML

    jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating,
    to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.
