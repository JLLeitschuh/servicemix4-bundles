    This bundle provides JDBC driver and classes allowing you to connect to a MongoDB database from Java code.

    MongoDB (from "humongous") is a scalable, high-performance, open source, document-oriented database.
    Written in C++, MongoDB features:

        * Document-oriented storage: JSON-style documents with dynamic schemas offer simplicity and power.
        * Full Index Support: Index on any attribute, just like you're used to.
        * Replication & High Availability: Mirror across LANs and WANs for scale and peace of mind.
        * Auto-Sharding: Scale horizontally without compromising functionality.
        * Querying: Rich, document-based queries.
        * Fast In-Place Updates: Atomic modifiers for contention-free performance.
        * Map/Reduce: Flexible aggregation and data processing.
        * GridFS: Store files of any size without complicating your stack.
