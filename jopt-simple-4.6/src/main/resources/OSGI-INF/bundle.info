\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    JOpt Simple is a Java library for parsing command line options, such as those you might pass to an invocation of javac.
    In the interest of striving for simplicity, as closely as possible JOpt Simple attempts to honor the command line
    option syntaxes of POSIX getopt() and GNU getopt_long(). It also aims to make option parser configuration and
    retrieval of options and their arguments simple and expressive, without being overly clever.
