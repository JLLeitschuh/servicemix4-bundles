    Apache OpenJPA is a Java persistence project at The Apache Software Foundation that can be used as a stand-alone
    POJO persistence layer or integrated into any Java EE compliant container and many other lightweight frameworks,
    such as Tomcat and Spring.

    The 2.0 releases (2.0.1 is the latest) are a production ready, compliant implementation of the JSR-317
    Java Persistence 2.0 specification, which is backwards compatible to the JPA 1.0 specification and passes the
    Sun JPA 2.0 Technology Compatibility Kit.
